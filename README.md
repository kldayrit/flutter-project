- Upon viewing your own posts, there are 2 trailing buttons in each post. One for edit and delete. Pressing delete will redirect you to a page like the post creation page, difference is that pressing edit posts calls the updatePost function that requires the parameters for the post's text and the post's publicity. It also requires the id of post itself to be appended to url of the api. The text and publicity of the post will be sent with the body of the request to api. Upon Pressing delete, it will call the deletePost() function that just needs the id of the post to remove it using the api.

### Challenges 
- The greatest challenge in this would be the the pagination. Although the idea behind pagination is easy to understand, it was hard to implement. But upon managing to implement it, the others became easier. Originally I was just planning to do the required tasks due to time constraints, but upon finishing them I noticed that the optional functions are mostly the same. So after finishing the required features, I just copied mostly the code in the required features and changed it up a bit to suit which ever featuer. This resulted in many boilerplate codes and an overall messy and spaghetti like code, nonetheless, I managed to implement it and that is what really matters.
